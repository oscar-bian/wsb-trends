Remember that we can put in limit orders for lower prices to ensure we get the stocks we want during these ladder attacks(which will inevitably happen) but as long as we hold we keep our position in this tug of war. Ladder attacks are a double edged sword that we can use to our advantage to buy more stock at cheaper prices    to hopefully and eventually buy up any and all the stock game stop has to offer(most of the reddit community knows this by now).
