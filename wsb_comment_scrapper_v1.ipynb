They want all the stock back they owe brokers, but they can’t win if we never sell no matter how low the price. Whether that’s $0, 19 cents, or $1. If you sell your stock in GME or AMC you’re only suiciding and negging. Remember that we can put in limit orders for lower prices to ensure we get the stocks we want during these ladder attacks(which will inevitably happen) but as long as we hold we keep our position in this tug of war. Ladder attacks are a double edged sword that we can use to our advantage to buy more stock at cheaper prices    to hopefully and eventually buy up any and all the stock game stop has to offer(most of the reddit community knows this by now). The only hand short firms have right now is manipulation whether that’s through media, numbers fudging(ladder attacks) , and ultimately emotional manipulation(if you’re emotionally invested in this). Don’t let your emotions make you sell. This may carry on for a few weeks to come, but eventually we’ll own all the stock and we’ll see a big payout. \n",
